# FireFly App Requirements:


# <u> Frontend: </u>

Run the frontend application with the following command:

`cd app/frontend/app && npm start`

## Requirements:

Map with preview of waypoints.

Maps preview with waypoints as selectable spots which fills in the side window with the respective data.

Side Window when spot selected:
- [ ] RGB photo
- [ ] IR Photo
- [ ] date, time
- [ ] Severity
- [ ] Selectable status (confirmation modal maybe)
- [ ] Status of hotspot (not viewed, viewed, visited, dismissed)


Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Make the side window dynamic rather than static
- [ ] Get waypoints for a specific time period (specified dates)

# <u> Backend: </u>
